My two take aways:
1) Turing is going to require a lot of work but it will be extremely rewarding.
2) Being an exceptional Google'r is going to be a key role to my success as a developer.

Shout out to my partner, Bri, for literally always having my back and supporting me in so many ways as I make this new journey into web development! She is the actual best.

Additional changes to push to github! Woohooo!
